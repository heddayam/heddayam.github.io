                I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago studying natural language processing. 
                I am advised by <a href="https://chenhaot.com">Chenhao Tan</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://ci.cs.uchicago.edu">Communication & Intelligence</a> and <a href="https://chicagohai.github.io/">Chicago Human+AI</a> labs. 
            </p>

                My research interests include building and evaluating the abilities of NLP systems, such as language models, to model messy, complex, and unusual real-world data.
                Lately, I've been working on:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://mheddaya.com/research/narratives/">Identifying and modeling the spread and impact of economic narratives.</a></li>
                    <li>Long-document reasoning and summarization in the legal domain.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I've worked on <a href="https://mheddaya.com/research/bargaining/">understanding how language shapes bilateral bargaining</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last summer, I interned at AWS AI Labs working on developing more efficient methods for LLM alignment.

                A few research questions/topics I am currently working on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is it important for language models to capture the pragmatic effects of metaphor use? What are the implications?</li>
                    <li>How do NLP models, and in particular large pre-trained language models (LLMs), process metaphorical language? How can we evaluate this ability?</li>
                    <li>Are there natural tasks that reveal how LLMs represent metaphorical expressions? Can we also design new tasks/benchmarks that quantify this ability?</li>
                    <li>How can NLP tools help improve cross-cultural communication?</li>
                </ul>
            </p> -->

                I received my bachelor's degree at the University of Washington. 
                After graduating, I spent a couple years as a member of <a href="https://nasmith.github.io">Noah Smith</a>'s research group, <a href="https://noahs-ark.github.io/">Noah's ARK</a>.
